                <h2>The Cell & Facilities</h2>
                <img src="img/post.png" alt="">
                <p>The Placement Office is responsible for campus placement at IET Lucknow. The Placement-in- Charge,
                    the Assistant Placement Officer, the Placement Office staff and the student representatives handle
                    various crucial tasks in the office like reaching out to companies, scheduling & executing placement
                    related activities and carrying out all official communication with recruiters and with students.
                    The team strives to strike a match between recruiter expectations and student aspirations. The team
                    of student representatives consists of the Placement Managers who coordinate the activities of other
                    student members and ensure compliance with various institute policies; Company Coordinators who
                    execute coordination with the recruiting organizations; and Department Placement Coordinators who
                    steer student preparedness and employability enhancement initiatives. The Placement Office is
                    well-equipped with excellent infrastructure to support every stage of the placement process.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The placement cell at our institution boasts a state-of-the-art workspace that caters to all official
                    proceedings. It includes various facilities designed to ensure a seamless and productive placement
                    process for both students and visiting companies.
                    To begin with, we have 6 air-conditioned interview cabins specifically designated for visiting
                    companies to conduct personal interviews or panel rounds. These cabins are equipped with high-speed
                    internet on WiFi-enabled PCs, ensuring smooth communication and connectivity. Additionally, printing
                    facilities are available for any necessary documentation.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For group discussions, there is a dedicated hall that accommodates placement procedure rounds by
                    visiting companies. This space allows for constructive discussions and evaluations during the
                    placement process.

                    To cater to the technical requirements of recruiters, our computer center offers labs from all
                    departments with modern and adequate facilities. These labs provide a hassle-free environment to
                    conduct technical rounds efficiently.</p>
                <br>
                <p>LFor presentations and lectures, we have a well-connected and air-conditioned presentation room. This
                    lecture theatre is equipped with a projection system, sound system, and live conferencing facility.
                    It can comfortably accommodate around 120 candidates, providing an ideal setting for various
                    presentations and interactive sessions.
                    Furthermore, we take pride in our newly constructed state-of-the-art auditorium, which has a
                    spacious seating capacity of 850. This auditorium serves as the venue for Pre-Placement Talks,
                    Seminars, and Demonstrations, providing a grand space for important events.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Recognizing the significance of training, we have a separate training classroom dedicated to students
                    from all departments. Equipped with necessary facilities and equipment, this training center aims to
                    enhance students' technical skills and prepare them professionally for their future endeavors.
                    In addition to the core facilities, we also extend hospitality to visiting HRs. We provide lodging
                    and transport facilities for their convenience. Moreover, we offer a diverse choice of cuisine for
                    meals, ensuring a comfortable and enjoyable stay during their visit.
                    With these comprehensive facilities and services, our placement cell strives to create an optimal
                    environment for successful placements and meaningful interactions between students and potential
                    employers.
